# 15puzzle
The classic 15 puzzle is implemented using a feature that allows players to see the next ten moves using one of two heuristic algorithms. New puzzles are unlocked after the previous one is completed.\
First, a welcome screen is shown for three seconds.\

The player can click on any square to move the piece. If it is blocked by other pieces, then nothing happens. Otherwise, it trades places with the blank square.\
If one of two heuristic algorithms are clicked (Solve -> AI H1, Solve -> AI H2), the program will figure out the next ten moves to correctly solve the puzzle. The two menu items are disabled as the program works. Then, when the next few moves have been solved, the "See Solution" item is enabled, allowing the player to see the next move every three seconds. Only the next ten moves in total will be shown.\
The image below shows the result of the first heuristic algorithm being used in puzzle #1.\

There is a "How to Play" window that opens if the menu item is selected (Options -> How to Play).\
